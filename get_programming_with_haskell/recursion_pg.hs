-- Euclid's algorithm
-- Find GCD (greated common divisor) for two numbers
{-
1. You start with two numbers, a and b.
2. If you divide a by b and the remainder is 0, clearly b is the GCD.
3. Otherwise, you change the value of a by assigning it the value of b (b becomes the new a). You also change the value of b to be the remainder you obtained in step 2 (the new b is the remainder of the original a divided by the original b).
4. Then repeat until a/b has no remainder.

Letâ€™s work through one example:

1. a = 20, b = 16
2. a/b = 20/16 = 1 remainder 4
3. a = 16, b = 4
4. a/b = 4 remainder 0
5. GCD = b = 4
